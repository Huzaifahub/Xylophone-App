## Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:

## audioplayers: 
For playing audio files.
## flutter: 
For building the UI.

## How It Works
## Audio Control:
When a button is pressed, the corresponding audio note is played. If the note is already playing, it pauses the sound. Each note corresponds to an audio file (note1.wav, note2.wav, etc.) stored in the assets folder.
## Custom Cards:
Each button is created using a custom card widget that displays the current play/pause state, along with a corresponding icon.
